# MVG U-Bahn Information

It is a terminal application for Linux 

## Performance
- It offers the information of the u-bahn stop that we want.
- We just have to execute the main file in the terminal to get command line where we can just write down the name of the stop that we want to get the information of the time it will take for the trains to arrive and in which direction
- To exit the application we just have to time __exit__ and it will stop it.
