# MVG U-Bahn Information

It is a terminal application for Linux 

## Performance
- It offers the information of the u-bahn stop that we want.
- First we must install the required libraries
- We just have to execute the main file in the terminal to get command line where we can just write down the name of the __stop__ that we want to get the information of the time it will take for the trains to arrive and in which direction
- To exit the application we just have to time __exit__ and it will stop it.
